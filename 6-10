1) Copy the required TW file from examples/tutorial folder to scratch folder
2) Add the below four lines at the end of the program before “Simulator::Run()”
#include "ns3/netanim-module.h"
AnimationInterface anim("first, xml");
AsciiTraceHelper ascii;
pointToPoint.EnableAsciiAll(ascii.CreateFileStream("first.tr"))
;
pointToPoint.EnablePcapAll("first");
3) Open terminal in ns-3.28 and run command ./waf build
4) Run command ./waf --run scratch/[first/second/third]
5) cd .. (to move back a folder)
6) Change directory to netanim-3.1 and run the command ./NetAnim to run the network
animator
7) Load the XML file [first.xml /second.xml / third.xml ] and run it
